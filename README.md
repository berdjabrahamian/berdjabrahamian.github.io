**Projects**

##### [Westminster Motors](https://www.westminstermotors.ca)

`Re-Branding, CMS System, Project Management, Full-Stack Development`

Lead developer, simple CMS site for a local British Car Repair shop. This was a challenge in itself, originally estimated 2 weeks for updating the old site for the relaunch of their 10 year anniversary. However I knew that the client deserved better and that the updates would keep the needle in place, not push it forward. I made the executive decision to take that time instead and we launched a whole new product in 2 weeks, leveraging open source tools to help us get there. Welcome to the new Westminster Motors.
